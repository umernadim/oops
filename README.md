# 📘 C# Classes and Objects Practice

This project demonstrates the fundamental and intermediate concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in **C#**.
It covers creating classes, defining fields, using constructors, initializing objects, applying methods, and implementing method overloading.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

* **Creating Classes and Objects**
* **Object Initialization (two methods)**
* **Using Fields and Methods**
* **Working with Lists of Objects**
* **Constructors and Parameterized Constructors**
* **Method Overloading**
* **Combining Classes with Loops and Conditions**

## 🧩 Task Overview

### **1. Creating a Simple Class (`Person` Class)**
✅ *Goal:* Understand how to define a class with properties and initialize an object using both:

* Default constructor + property assignment.
* Object initializer syntax.

### **2. Bottle Class Example**
✅ *Goal:* Learn to create simple classes with properties and display object data.

### **3. Class with a Method (`Calculator` Class)**
✅ *Goal:* Understand how to define and call methods inside a class.

### **4. List of Objects (`Mobile` Class Example)**
✅ *Goal:* Practice creating and iterating over a list of custom objects.

## 🏗️ Constructors

### **5. Parameterized Constructor (`Toyota` Class)**
✅ *Goal:* Learn to use constructors for initializing class data.

### **6. Creating List of Objects Using Constructor (`Student` Class)**
✅ *Goal:* Learn to instantiate multiple objects dynamically using constructors.

### **7. Product List with Constructor**
✅ *Goal:* Practice constructors with multiple parameters and lists.

### **8. Student Marks Average Calculator**
✅ *Goal:* Combine constructors and methods for data calculation.

### **9. Employee Salary Calculator**
✅ *Goal:* Demonstrate class methods and business logic inside constructors.

## 🔄 Method Overloading

### **10. Suzuki Car Example**
✅ *Goal:* Learn how **method and constructor overloading** allow multiple ways to create objects.

## 🧾 Summary

| Concept             | Description                                                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Class**           | Blueprint for creating objects.                             |
| **Object**          | Instance of a class containing real data.                   |
| **Constructor**     | Initializes an object’s data when created.                  |
| **Method**          | Performs an action using object data.                       |
| **Overloading**     | Multiple constructors or methods with different parameters. |
| **List of Objects** | Used to manage multiple instances efficiently.              |

## 🏁 Conclusion

Through these exercises, you’ve practiced:

* Declaring and using **classes and objects**.
* Creating **constructors** and understanding their purpose.
* Working with **lists of custom objects**.
* Using **methods** and **method overloading** effectively.

These tasks form the **foundation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in C# and are essential for building scalable applications.
